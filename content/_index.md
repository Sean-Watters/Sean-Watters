I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde, where I am a member of the [Mathematically Structured Programming Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/). 
Prior to that, I did a BSc in Computer Science, also at Strathclyde.

My PhD is on correct-by-construction model checking for the modal Î¼-calculus. 
My broad interests are dependently-typed functional programming languages, constructive logic, and type theory.

I like playing with loopy data types. 
I write a lot of Agda code.
