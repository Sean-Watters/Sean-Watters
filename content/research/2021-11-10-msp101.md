abstract = """
Modal logic can be applied to a diverse range of use-cases by fixing different notions of model and modality. Our motivation today will be the formal verification technique of model checking, and with this in mind, I will focus on temporal logic. In temporal logics, the models represent systems which change over time, and the modalities allow us to reason about exactly how they proceed in time.

I will first introduce basic relational modal logic, and show its limitations in this domain. We will then go on a tour of LTL, CTL, CTL*, and the modal mu-calculus. Key destinations on the tour will include the respective expressive power and model-checking complexity of each, particularly in comparison to the mu-calculus.
